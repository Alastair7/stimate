# STIMATE: DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL

## Purpose of this

I am creating this journal to have a track of my progress with this project.
Here I will write my thoughts, reminders and milestones.

## PROGRESS

### 20-09-2024

I thought I had this journal created but I was mistaken, so i decided to create it. Also I have splitted the project in two parts: **stimate-client** and **stimate-server**.

I was reading about Websockets, how to configure TS and discovered that tsx works better than ts-node. At least I could execute my server easily with tsx.
